Type Command:  .\TestUserImport.ps1
Confirm that the test user was successful and there are no errors.

Once Complete, go into Active Directory, Do a query to find all users, sort by description, highlight all users go to properties, and choose to change the desciption to blank.  The Import is there to quickly find the users incase everything blows up

Note:  I had to put waits inside the commands so AD can see the new users.  Without them it moved too fast and failed.  Each user will take 20-25 secs to be created.
