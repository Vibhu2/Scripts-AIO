## Escape Characher

a Back slash \ is used as an escape character if we want the markdown engine to consider certain symbol as it is.

# Representing Source Code in Markdown

  

in order to represent a code we use Back Tick (\`) for eg  
 `get-childitem`

  

or

we can use **4 Tab spaces** and in some case just **1 Tab space** will also work before a code line and it will automatically be taken as a code for eg.

				Get-Childitem
				Get-Process
				Get-Service
				Get-Help
	Note:- inside of a code block all the special characters are avoided as exception.
# List in Markdown.
 we can denote a list in markdown by three characters \( * or + or - ) examples are as below.  
				 

* Item1

+ Item2

- item3

		**or we can also make the list as below**

1. Item a

2. Item b

3. Item c

4. Item d

## Nested List
while creating a multi leavel list make a normal list and for sub items we need to give 2 or 4 indent spaces it depends on the render engine

* item a

			* item3
* Item b
	* item 1
	* item 2

*[msb]: www.Google.com is "Google Search engine".
4. Google [msb] 
*note:-* this MSB reference methord may or may not work according to the rendering engine ideall the below line should disappear while rendering engine.

**Two important rules:**
1. Make sure you have an **empty line** after the closing `</summary>` tag, otherwise the markdown/code blocks won't show correctly.
2. Make sure you have an **empty line** after the closing `</details>` tag if you have multiple collapsible sections.
